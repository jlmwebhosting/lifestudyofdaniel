{"name":"Lifestudyofdaniel","tagline":"","body":"Welcome to Life Study of Daniel\r\n\r\nDaniel 6 is very crucial because it shows us how God carries out His economy with His elect for Christ's coming. God desires to carry out His economy, but man is needed to pray for His economy on earth. God carries out His economy on the earth through His faithful channels of prayer. Satan's strategy is to frustrate the prayer which is for God's move. Thus, the center of this chapter is man's prayer for the carrying out of God's economy.\r\nGod's move is like a train which must have rails for its move. Man's prayers are like the rails which pave the way for God's move to go on. There is no other way to bring God's economy into fullness and into fulfillment except by prayer. This is the inner secret of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n. The case of Nebuchadnezzar teaches us that we need to be careful and not consider what we have achieved. The palace built by Nebuchadnezzar was vast. When he took a walk on the roof of that palace, he became proud and said, \"Is this not Babylon the great, which I have built up as a royal house by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?\" (4:30). This should warn us that our achievement may make us proud, and this may usher in God's judgment. God's judgment upon Nebuchadnezzar reduced him to nothing. This was the reason he could say of the Lord, \"All the inhabitants of earth are considered as nothing, / But He does according to His will in the army of heaven / And among the inhabitants of the earth; / And there is no one who can resist His hand / Or say to Him, What are You doing?\" (4:35). In 4:37 concerning the Lord, Nebuchadnezzar went on to say, \"He is able to abase those who walk in pride.\" Belshazzar should have learned the lesson from Nebuchadnezzar's experience; however, he did not learn the lesson and suffered as a result.\r\n\r\nAmong all the events in chapter five, or going along with all these events, God's economy was being carried out. God knew how to manage the world situation. Do not think that Darius the Mede came to kill Belshazzar by accident. No, that was God carrying out His economy. If He had left the empire in the hand of the Babylonians, there could never have been a return of the captives to Israel. Therefore, the empire had to be changed from gold to silver. This was God's doing. This was God's tempering, His balance in His economy, to fulfill His plan.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
